###Note:
You could use this theme almost as is. But There are several things you have to do before you use this theme.
* open up \_config.yml 
  You need to change sitename, tagline and url value to make theme work nicely. It still works if you didn't but if you publish as your site using this theme, then you must change them.

* open up \_includes/ga.html and edit UA-XXXXX-X with your site ID on Google Analytics.
  If you don't need stats then delete {% include ga.html %} line on \_layouts\default.htm.

This theme use *style* variable in [YAML Front Matter](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/yaml-front-matter) to change some css rules, use *text* for default design. If you like to showcasing your or other works like in [my blog](http://layouts.studiomohawk.com/), use *showcase*.
